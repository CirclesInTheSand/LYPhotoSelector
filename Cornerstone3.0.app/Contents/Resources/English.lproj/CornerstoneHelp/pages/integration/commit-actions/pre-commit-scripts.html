  <h1>Pre-Commit Scripts</h1>
  <p>Pre-commit scripts are run when the user clicks <span class="uiref">Commit Changes</span> in the <a href="../../working/commit-view.html">commit view</a>, but before the commit is started (see <a href="index.html#commit-process">the commit process</a> for more information).</p>
  <p>A pre-commit script can be run in one of two ways:</p>
  <ol>
  	<li>
  		<p><strong>Once for the entire working copy</strong></p>
  		<p>The script is run once. The POSIX path of the working copy&rsquo;s top folder is passed to the script as its only parameter.</p>
  		<p>Pre-commit scripts are run even if no items are checked in the commit view&rsquo;s <span class="uiref">Changes</span> list.</p>
  	</li>
  	<li>
  		<p><strong>Once for each checked item in the commit view&rsquo;s <span class="uiref">Changes</span> list</strong></p>
  		<p>The script is run multiple times, once for each checked item in the commit view&rsquo;s <span class="uiref">Changes</span> list. The POSIX path of the changed item is passed to the script as its only parameter.</p>
  		<p>Cornerstone will abort script execution as soon as the first error is encountered.</p>
  	</li>
  </ol>
  <div class="note">
  	<p>The user is prompted when a pre-commit script raises an error&mdash;i.e. exits with a value other than zero&mdash;with the option to continue or cancel the commit.</p>
  	<p>Pre-commit scripts can therefore be used to validate changes before a commit.</p>
  </div>
  
  <h2>Prepare Scripts vs. Pre-Commit Scripts</h2>
  <p>On the face of it, pre-commit scripts sound similar to prepare scripts. This is true when run once for the entire working copy. However there are significant differences when run once per item:</p>
  <ol>
  	<li>
  		<p>Prepare scripts can modify the working copy to change the set of items to be committed. This is not the case with a pre-commit script.</p>
  		<p>For example, if you need to change unmodified files (or revert changed files)&mdash;thus changing the set of files to be committed&mdash;then you should use a prepare script.</p>
  	</li>
  	<li>
  		<p>The user may invest significant time writing their log message selecting the files for commit. Subsequently aborting the commit as a result of pre-commit validation would not be appropriate.</p>
  		<p>Pre-commit validation is better suited to prepare scripts.</p>
  	</li>
  	<li>
  		<p>Per-item pre-commit scripts are run once for each item to be committed. Unchecked items in the commit view&rsquo;s <span class="uiref">Changes</span> list are not committed and are therefore not passed to the pre-commit script.</p>
  		<p>Time-consuming operations should therefore be placed in pre-commit scripts.</p>
  	</li>
  	<li>
  		<p>The user has the opportunity to cancel the commit while the commit view is displayed. Destructive, non-repeatable operations should therefore be run as pre-commit scripts.</p>
  	</li>
  </ol>
  
  <h2>Selecting a Script for Execution</h2>
  <p>Pre-commit scripts are defined for each working copy:</p>
  <div class="task">
  	<ol>
  		<li>
  			<p>Start a commit operation by selecting one or more changed items and choosing the <span class="uiref">Commit</span> command from the <span class="uiref">Working Copy</span> menu (key equivalent <span class="key">âŒ˜T</span>).</p>
  		</li>
  		<li>
  			<p>Expand the <span class="uiref">Options</span> section at the bottom of the commit view.</p>
  		</li>
  		<li>
  			<p>Locate the <span class="uiref">Before continuing</span> options in the <span class="uiref">Actions</span> section.</p>
  		</li>
  		<li>
  			<p>Check the <span class="uiref">Run script</span> button.</p>
  		</li>
  		<li>
  			<p>Use the pop-up to choose the script to run.</p>
  		</li>
  		<li>
  			<p>Specify whether the script should be run once for the entire working copy or once for each item.</p>
  		</li>
  	</ol>
  </div>
  
  <h2>Possible Uses for Pre-Commit Scripts</h2>
  <ul>
  	<li>
  		<p>Updating the thumbnail for a modified image file and storing it as a custom property.</p>
  	</li>
  	<li>
  		<p>Assign properties to newly-added files if the file pattern matching provided by Subversion&rsquo;s auto-props feature is insufficient.</p>
  	</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Example Script</h2>
  <table class="summary">
  	<tr>
  		<td>Purpose</td>
  		<td>
  			<p>Create a 120px thumbnail image for the specified image and store it in a custom property called <code>thumbnail</code>. Do nothing if the input file is not an image</p>
  			<p>The script also demonstrates how to update the sidecar property (<code>thumbnail:attributes</code>) created by Cornerstone for file properties such that additional
  information about the thumbnail is displayed in the <a href="../../working/inspector.html">inspector</a></p>
