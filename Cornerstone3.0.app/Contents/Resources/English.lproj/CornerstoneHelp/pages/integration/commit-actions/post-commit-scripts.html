  <h1>Post-Commit Scripts</h1>
  <p>Post-commit scripts are run after the items selected in the <a href="../../working/commit-view.html">commit view</a> have been successfully committed to the repository (see <a href="index.html#commit-process">the commit process</a> for more information).</p>
  <p>A post-commit script can be run in one of two ways:</p>
  <ol>
  	<li>
  		<p><strong>Once for the entire working copy</strong></p>
  		<p>The script is run once. The POSIX path of the working copy&rsquo;s top folder is passed to the script as its only parameter.</p>
  	</li>
  	<li>
  		<p><strong>Once for each checked item in the commit view&rsquo;s <span class="uiref">Changes</span> list</strong></p>
  		<p>The script is run multiple times, once for each checked item in the commit view&rsquo;s <span class="uiref">Changes</span> list. The POSIX path of the changed item is passed to the script as its only parameter.</p>
  		<p>Cornerstone will abort script execution as soon as the first error is encountered.</p>
  	</li>
  </ol>
  <div class="note">
		<p>Post-commit scripts are only run when the commit operation results in a new revision in the repository, i.e. scripts are not run when <span class="uiref">Commit Changes</span> is pressed with no items selected in the <span class="uiref">Changes</span> list.</p>
  </div>
    
  <h2>Selecting a Script for Execution</h2>
  <p>Post-commit scripts are defined for each working copy:</p>
  <div class="task">
  	<ol>
  		<li>
  			<p>Start a commit operation by selecting one or more changed items and choosing the <span class="uiref">Commit</span> command from the <span class="uiref">Working Copy</span> menu (key equivalent <span class="key">âŒ˜T</span>).</p>
  		</li>
  		<li>
  			<p>Expand the <span class="uiref">Options</span> section at the bottom of the commit view.</p>
  		</li>
  		<li>
  			<p>Locate the <span class="uiref">After committing</span> options in the <span class="uiref">Actions</span> section.</p>
  		</li>
  		<li>
  			<p>Check the <span class="uiref">Run script</span> button.</p>
  		</li>
  		<li>
  			<p>Use the pop-up to choose the script to run.</p>
  		</li>
  		<li>
  			<p>Specify whether the script should be run once for the entire working copy or once for each item.</p>
  		</li>
  	</ol>
  </div>
  
  <h2>Possible Uses for Post-Commit Actions</h2>
  <ul>
  	<li>Exporting the latest revision from the repository and <code>rsync</code>-ing to a web server for deployment.</li>
  	<li>Copying the commit&rsquo;s log message to the clipboard to be pasted into an issue tracking system.</li>
  	<li>Scanning the commit&rsquo;s log message for an issue tracking number and closing the issue in the issue tracking system.</li>
  	<li>Writing the commit&rsquo;s log entry to a personal log file for use as a reference when making out a customer invoice or completing a status report.</li>
  	<li>Sending other team members a mail when changes are made to particular files or folders.</li>
  	<li>Kick-starting a continuous build system.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Example Script</h2>
  <table class="summary">
  	<tr>
  		<td>Purpose</td>
  		<td>Obtain the last log item from the working copy&rsquo;s history (i.e. log) and copy it to the clipboard</td>
  	</tr>
  	<tr>
  		<td>Type</td>
  		<td>Working copy</td>
  	</tr>
  	<tr>
  		<td>Argument</td>
  		<td>Path to a working copy</td>
  	</tr>
  </table>
  
  <div class="script">
  	<pre>#!/usr/bin/env bash

# Copies the contents of the last log item for the working copy to
# the clipboard.
#
# Usage:
#   CopyLogToClipboard working-copy
#
# Arguments:
#   $1 path to a working copy

svn log "$1" -r HEAD --limit 1 --verbose | pbcopy
		</pre>
  </div>
  
	<p><code>$1</code> is used to reference the path of the working copy that was committed. It is supplied as the script&rsquo;s single argument.</p>
	
	<div class="note">
		<p>It is recommended that <code>$1</code> be placed in quotation marks in order that the script functions correctly with paths containing space characters.</p>
	</div>
