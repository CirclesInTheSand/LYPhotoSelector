		<p>Commonly known as <span class="term">blame</span> (after the <code>svn</code> function of the same name), annotations are attribution tags which can be displayed for the lines that make up a given version (i.e. revision) of a text file.</p>
		<p>This information can be used to determine who was responsible for a particular section of a file and when the change was committed, without having to trawl through a file&rsquo;s log to determine when the lines were last changed.</p>
		<p>This capability is commonly used to attribute changes to their contributor, resulting in blame should the relevant code contain bugs or other flaws, hence the name.</p>
		<p>Some users find the <span class="term">blame</span> moniker to be too negative and prefer the terms <span class="term">praise</span> or <span class="term">annotations</span>.</p>
