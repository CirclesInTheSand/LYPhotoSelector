  <h1>External Definitions</h1>

	<div class="inset">
		<p>Subversion allows a working copy to be constructed from folders checked out of several locations in one or more repositories through the use of <span class="term">external definitions</span>.</p>
		<p>An external definition specifies that when a folder is checked out of a repository, a sub-folder is checked out of another location. In this way, a working copy can be comprised of content from several unrelated locations.</p>
		<p>This can be useful in a number of situations:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				An organization&rsquo;s app may be dependent on a library shared between several projects.
				<p>Although the shared library is not located within the project&rsquo;s folder in the repository, it can be checked out from the shared location into the working copy using an external definition.</p></li>
			<li>
				A project is dependent on an open source project which is managed in a publicly accessible Subversion repository.
				<p>An external definition can be used to automatically obtain the open source code into the project&rsquo;s working copy when checked out.</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>External definitions are defined using the <a href="#svn:externals"><code>svn:externals</code></a> property. As such, they are subject to the same versioning as the folders they are defined on.</p>
		<p>Each external definition defines the following information:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The source URL from which the external dependency will be checked out.</li>
			<li>The revision which should be checked out.</li>
			<li>The working copy folder (relative to the folder defining the <code>svn:externals</code> property) into which the external dependency will be checked out.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	
	<h2 class="term"><a id="svn:externals">svn:externals</a></h2>
	<div class="inset">
		<p>The <code>svn:externals</code> property is a simple text value which contains a list of <a href="#external"><span class="term">external definitions.</span></a></p>
		<p>Each definition is specified on its own line in the form:</p>
		<pre>[revision] URL folder</pre>
		<p>where:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><span class="term">revision</span> (optional) specifies the revision to check out. The latest revision (i.e. HEAD) will be checked out if <span class="term">revision</span> is not specified.</li>
			<li><span class="term">URL</span> specifies the URL of the folder to check out.
			<div class="note">
				<p>Several URL formats are accepted by Subversion, including both absolute and relative URLs. See the <a href="../../working/url-formats.html">External Definition URL Formats</a> help topic or Subversion documentation included with Cornerstone (<span class="uiref">Help &gt; Subversion Documentation</span>) for more information.</p>
			</div></li>
			<li><span class="term">folder</span> specifies the path of a folder, relative to the folder which declares the <code>svn:externals</code> property into which the contents of <span class="term">URL</span> should be checked out.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>For example the following definition:</p>
		<pre>-r32849 http://svn.webkit.org/trunk dependencies/webkit</pre>
		<p>will check out revision 32,849 of <code>http://svn.webkit.org/trunk</code> into the <code>dependencies/webkit</code> sub-folder of the folder which is declaring the property.</p>
		<p>See the Subversion documentation included with Cornerstone (<span class="uiref">Help &gt; Subversion Documentation</span>) for more detailed information on the format of the <code>svn:externals</code> property.</p>
