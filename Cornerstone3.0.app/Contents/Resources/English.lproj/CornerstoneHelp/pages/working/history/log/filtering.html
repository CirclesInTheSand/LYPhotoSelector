  <h1>Filtering the Log View</h1>
	<p>The log view&rsquo;s filter bar allows you to quickly apply commonly-used filters to the displayed log items. You can also filter the contents of the view by text.</p>
	<p><img class="comp" src="../../../../images/log-view-filter.png" srcset="../../../../images/log-view-filter@2x.png 2x"/></p>
	<p>The filters are as follows:</p>
	
	<h3 class="filter">All <span class="small-key">^A</span></h3>
	<p>Removes the other filters to show all items.</p>
	<p>Clicking the <span class="uiref">All</span> button does not reset the text in the filter&rsquo;s search field. Use the <span class="uiref">View > Show All</span> (key equivalent <span class="key">âŒ˜\</span>) function to do this.</p>
	
	<h3 class="filter">My Changes <span class="small-key">^Y</span></h3>
	<p>Shows only log items committed by the current user.</p>
	<div class="note">
		<p>The current user is determined from the username for the current repository URL. For <code>file://</code> URLs, the operating system username is used.</p>
		<p>This filter is only available if a username is present in the repository URL.</p>
	</div>
	
	<h3 class="filter">Others&rsquo; Changes <span class="small-key">^P</span></h3>
	<p>Shows only the log items committed by users <em>other</em> than the current user.</p>
	<div class="note">
		<p>This filter is only available if a username is present in the repository URL.</p>
	</div>
  
	<h3 class="filter">Newer <span class="small-key">^N</span></h3>
	<p>Shows only the log items newer than the working revision of the selected file or folder.</p>
	<div class="note">
		<p>This filter is only available if a working copy item is selected.</p>
	</div>

	<h3 class="filter">Today <span class="small-key">^T</span></h3>
	<p>Shows only the log items committed during the current calendar day.</p>

	<h3 class="filter">This Week <span class="small-key">^W</span></h3>
	<p>Shows only the log items committed during the current calendar week.</p>

	<h3 class="filter">This Month <span class="small-key">^M</span></h3>
	<p>Shows only the log items committed during the current calendar month.</p>

	<h3 class="filter">Added <span class="small-key">^E</span></h3>
	<p>Shows only the log items which contain added (or copied) files in the revision&rsquo;s change set.</p>

	<h3 class="filter">Deleted <span class="small-key">^D</span></h3>
	<p>Shows only the log items which contain deleted files in the revision&rsquo;s change set.</p>

	<h3 class="filter">Replaced <span class="small-key">^R</span></h3>
	<p>Shows only the log items which contain replaced files in the revision&rsquo;s change set. A file is replaced when it is deleted and then added again in a single revision.</p>
