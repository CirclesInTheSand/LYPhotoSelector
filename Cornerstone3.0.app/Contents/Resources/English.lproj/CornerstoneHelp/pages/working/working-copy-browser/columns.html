  <h1>Working Copy Browser Columns</h1>
  <ul class="plain">
  	<li>
  		<h2>Name</h2>
  		<p>The name of the file or folder. The name will be displayed in a lighter color if the file is not present in the file system or is ignored. Ignored and external items are displayed using italic text.</p>

  	<li>
  		<h2>Working Copy Status <img class="template" src="../../../images/status-column-header.png" srcset="../../../images/status-column-header@2x.png 2x"/></h2>
  		<p>The status of the working copy file. This column will contain one of the following icons for non-normal (i.e. changed) files. The icons&rsquo; letters are consistent with those used by Subversion to indicate the various statuses on the command-line.</p>
  		<table class="status-markers">
  			<tr>
  				<td><img src="../../../images/marker-added.png" srcset="../../../images/marker-added@2x.png 2x"/></td>
  				<td>Added</td>
  				<td>The file or folder has been added to the working copy but has not yet been committed to the repository. Items which have been copied, moved or renamed are also displayed as added until committed.</td>
  			</tr>
  			<tr>
  				<td><img src="../../../images/marker-conflicted.png" srcset="../../../images/marker-conflicted@2x.png 2x"/></td>
  				<td>Conflicted</td>
  				<td>Changes made to the working copy version conflict with changes that have been committed to the repository since the last working copy update. Conflicts must be resolved before the file can can be committed to the repository. See <a href="../resolving-conflicts.html">Resolving Conflicts</a> for more information.</td>
  			</tr>
  			<tr>
  				<td><img src="../../../images/marker-deleted.png" srcset="../../../images/marker-deleted@2x.png 2x"/></td>

  		<p>Property status icons are displayed for items which have not otherwise been modified, i.e. the content modifications listed above take precedence over property modification.</p>
  		<p>Open the inspector if you need to see both the content and property statuses at the same time.</p>

  		<p>The status of the file or folder in the repository. This column is only displayed if <span class="uiref">View &gt; Show Repository Status</span> is enabled.</p>
  		<div class="note">
  			<p>Enabling <span class="uiref">View &gt; Show Repository Status</span> will cause Cornerstone to contact the repository for each refresh, commit and update. This can negatively affect refresh speed if repository access is slow or the working copy contains a large number of files.</p>
  		</div>
  	</li>
  	
  	<li>
  		<h2>Date Modified</h2>
  		<p>The date at which the file or folder was last modified. For unchanged items this date will be equivalent to the date of the item&rsquo;s revision. The file&rsquo;s last modification date in the file system is displayed for modified files.</p>
  	</li>
  	
  	<li>
  		<h2>Size</h2>
  		<p>The size of the file.</p>
  	</li>

  		<h2>Lock Status <img class="template" src="../../../images/lock-owned.png" srcset="../../../images/lock-owned@2x.png 2x"/></h2>
  		<p>Working copy items can have one of the following lock statuses:</p>
  		<table class="status-markers">
  			<tr>
  				<td></td>
  				<td>Unlocked</td>
  				<td>The file is not locked.</td>
  			</tr>
  			<tr>
  				<td><img class="template-light" src="../../../images/lock-owned.png" srcset="../../../images/lock-owned@2x.png 2x"/></td>

  				<td><img class="template-light" src="../../../images/lock-normal.png" srcset="../../../images/lock-normal@2x.png 2x"/></td>

  				<td>All files and folders at all levels</td>
  				<td><code>infinite</code></td>
