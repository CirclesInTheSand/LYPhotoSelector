  <h1>Renaming Working Copy Items</h1>
  <p>Rename items in a working copy using one of the following methods:</p>
  <div class="task">
  	<ol>
  		<li>Select the item to rename and then single-click the item to start editing the name</li>
  		<li>Select the item to rename and press the <span class="key">Return</span> (⏎) key.</li>
  		<li>Confirm the pressing the <span class="key">Return</span> (⏎) key or clicking on another item in the browser.</li>
  		<li>You can cancel the rename at any time by pressing the <span class="key">Escape</span> (⎋) key.</li>
  	</ol>
  </div>
  <p>Subversion implements a rename as a move operation. As a result, the original file is marked for deletion and added to the working copy with the new name.</p>    
  <h2>Undoing a Rename</h2>
  <p>You can use the <span class="uiref">Revert</span> function to undo a rename using the following steps:</p>
  <div class="task">
  	<ol>
  		<li>Select the original file which was scheduled for deletion and revert it to the BASE version using the <span class="uiref">Revert</span> function. The file is restored to the BASE version and is no longer scheduled for deletion.</li>
  		<li>Select the file that is scheduled for addition to the repository and remove the file using the <span class="uiref">Delete</span> function.</li>
  	</ol>
  </div>
  
  <h2>Committing a Rename</h2>
  <div class="note">
  <p>In order to preserve the rename operation correctly in the repository&rsquo;s history, it is recommended that you commit both the deleted and added items at the same time.</p>
