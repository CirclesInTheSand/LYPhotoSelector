	<h1>Cleaning a Working Copy</h1>
	<p>Subversion locks a working copy whenever it performs operations such as commits, updates, merges etc. Normally, these locks are released when an operation completes, regardless of the outcome of the operation.</p>
	<p>If Cornerstone is unable to complete an operation due to interruption (e.g. when force-quit) then the locks will not be released. As a result, future attempts to commit, update merge etc. will fail with an error.</p>
	<p>The <span class="uiref">Clean</span> command can be used to recover from such situations by cleaning up any unreleased locks in a working copy. The command is not context-sensitive and always cleans the entire working copy.</p>
  
  <p>To clean a working copy:</p>
  
  <div class="task">
  	<ol>
  		<li>
  			<p>Select the working copy to relocate in the source list.</p>
  		</li>
  		<li>
  			<p>Select the <span class="uiref">Clean</span> item in the <span class="uiref">Working Copy</span> menu.</p>
  		</li>
  	</ol>
  </div>

	<p>Any locks held by the working copy are released and interrupted operations are completed such that the working copy has a known good state.</p>
	<div class="note">
		<p>The <span class="uiref">Clean</span> command does not clean a working copy&rsquo;s externals. You will need to use the <code>svn cleanup</code> command in Terminal to clean externals.</p>
