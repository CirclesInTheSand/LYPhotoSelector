	<h1>Relocating a Working Copy</h1>
  <p>The <span class="uiref">Relocate To</span> command is used to change the URL that a working copy uses to locate the corresponding folder in the repository.</p>
  
  <div class="note">
  	<p>Cornerstone tries to keep working copies&rsquo; URLs in sync with the originating repository, and will prompt to automatically relocate working copies after their repository&rsquo;s settings are edited.</p>
  	<p>Using the <span class="uiref">Relocate To</span> function to manually relocate a working copy is an advanced topic. See the <a href="../introduction/terminology/working-copies.html#relocate">terminology</a> section for information on situations where relocation is appropriate.</p>
  </div>
  
  <p>To relocate a working copy:</p>
  
  <div class="task">
  	<ol>
  		<li>
  			<p>Select the working copy to relocate in the source list.</p>
  			<div class="note">
  				<p>It is not possible to relocate individual items in a working copy.</p>
  			</div>
  		</li>
  		<li>
  			<p>Select the <span class="uiref">Relocate To</span> command from the <span class="uiref">Working Copy</span> menu.</p>
  		</li>
  		<li>
  			<p>Select the repository you wish to relocate to from list in the displayed submenu.</p>
  			<div class="note">
  				<p>You will need to <a href="../getting-started/index.html">add a new repository</a> if the required repository is not listed.</p>
  			</div>
  		</li>
  	</ol>
  </div>

	<p>Cornerstone relocates the working copy to the new repository by rewriting the working copy&rsquo;s metadata. The contents of the working copy are not otherwise modified.</p>
	<div class="note">
		<p>The new URL is calculated from the working copy&rsquo;s location relative to the previous repository.</p>
		<p>It is not possible to relocate a working copy to refer to a different location in the repository. Consider <a href="switching.html">switching</a> if you need to do this.</p>
